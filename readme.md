# Tasks app 

In this project we are going to develop our own trello based app using Express (Node.js Framework) to handle the requests sent to the Backend and pure vanilla JavaScript in combination with CSS (using tools like Sass as Css pre-procesor and Flex-box) to develop the front-end.

## Technologies I employed

- Express (Node.js Framework)
- fetch (for the client requests)
- DOM manipulation using vanilla JS
- Sass and Flexbox for the CSS
- MongoDB as the database
- Mongoose as the MongoDB driver in the backend
